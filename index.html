            <h3> Graduation Details</h3>
            <hr>
            <h5> Commencement Ceremony </h5>
            <p> 
                Due to Covid, WashU has split the commencement ceremony into 6 subsections. I will be graduating with all other students in the 
                School of Engineering at 8:00 AM on Thursday. Normally, commencement is held in Brookings Quad but it has been moved to Francis Field this year.
                Engineering is the very first commencement ceremony in this new model, so we're the Guinea Pigs. The commencement speaker this year is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, but we will probably be hearing 
                a recording of his speech since it will be needed in six seperate cermonies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Commencement parking can be found at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cRteVvWx3WtvVrY96"> Danforth University Center </a>. Alternatively, we can 
                park at David's apartment and walk to Francis Field -- it's only about 1/2 a mile.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5> WashU's Campus </h5>
            <p> 
                You are welcome to walk around WashU's campus at any point this week. It's a very walkable campus, with the majority of the academics forming a ~1 mile stretch
                to Forest Park. Most of the buildings still require keycard access due to Covid, but I should be able to swipe you in if you want to go inside.
                The administration asks that people continue to wear masks while inside. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                WashU has an interesting and very pretty campus. If people are interested, I'm happy to break out my tour guide training and show people around.

            <h3> Things to Do in St. Louis</h3>
            <hr>
            <h5> Delmar Loop </h5>
            <p> 
                Located just north of campus, this is one of the more interesting streets in St. Louis. The Loop is home to a number of restaurants, bars, and shops. 
                There are Hollywood Boulevard-style stars for notable St. Louisians and people with connections to the area along the length of the Loop.
                Notable spots:
                <ul>
                    <li> Vintage Vinyl -- Record store with long history and a huge selection. </li>
                    <li> Blueberry Hill -- Diner and bar. Food is mediocre, but cool history -- Chuck Berry played free sets in the basement lounge every Friday until his death.</li>
                    <li> Seoul Taco -- Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant. Started as a food truck, now expanding across the Midwest. Good for a quick bite. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5> Forest Park </h5>
            <p> 
                Located East of Campus, this is one of the largest urban parks in the United States. On a sunny day, it's a beautiful place to go for a walk / run or to enjoy the sunset.
                Notable spots: 
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6GXGqsHxPj9JVNQ58"> Art Hill</a> -- Best spot for picnicking / sledding / sunset-watching in St. Louis. At the top of the hill is the St. Louis and at the bottom is the basin, with fountains and the occasional paddle-boarder.</li>
                    <li> <a href="https://g.page/Saint-Louis-Art-Museum?share"> St. Louis Art Museum</a> -- Free entry, large collection of American and European Art. Excellent collection of 20th Century German art, in part the result of famous artists like Max Ernst who fled the Nazis and became professors at WashU.</li>
                    <li> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cVEuSC6AB1C1N8Ut8"> St. Louis Zoo </a> -- Free zoo, walkable from Art Hill / Art Museum</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5> Downtown </h5>
            <p> 
                Downtown St. Louis is pretty quiet in a way that can be eerie. There are still interesting areas to explore, but I don't recommend being there late at night.
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/55jbM9T4WEdvwUDq9">Gateway Arch</a> -- Very cool, especially up close. Gardens and museum recently renovated when the Arch became a National Park.</li>
                    <li> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1NF65hxADKfEbBQh9">City Museum</a> -- Former shoe warehouse turned into a playground / art instillation. Interesting history. Definitely worth checking out their website.</li>
                    <li> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1NF65hxADKfEbBQh9">Cardinals Ballpark Village</a> -- Baseball stadium & a number of nearby bars, restaurants, etc. Lots of live music and activity on a game night. </li>
                </ul>
